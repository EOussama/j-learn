## Description
Picked a huge interest in learning Japanese lately, while taking some free online course (_very effective, but not certainly not enough_), I thought I would hit two birds with the same stone, and create a flask website of both test what I've learned so far, in both the **J** and **P** languages.
No database interaction or anything of that mass is planned, just plain old file systems, probably some **JSON** magic.
